Caching in BigQuery might not be effective or efficient in the following scenarios:

Frequently Updated Data: If the underlying data is updated frequently, the cached data may become stale, leading to inaccurate results. In such cases, relying on real-time queries might be more appropriate.
Complex Queries: Highly complex queries involving multiple joins, aggregations, or window functions may not benefit significantly from caching. The overhead of caching and retrieving cached data might outweigh the performance gains.
Large Datasets: For extremely large datasets that cannot fit entirely in memory, caching might not be practical due to the limitations of available cache storage. In these cases, other optimization techniques like partitioning, clustering, or materialized views might be more effective.
